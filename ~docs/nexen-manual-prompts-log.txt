There is never Mesen anything; We are Nexen now; continue;

always focus on the release build, but I was was using a release build of 1.0.0 and it did not run correctly, make the release build run; fix all issues and problems and code issues; we want our released version to work; continue;

Release version 1.0.1 update docs, and make sure this runs! continue;

Release Nexen 1.0.1 on github; comtmue;

The 1.0.1 release zip should not have all the code of this project, it should have only that exe and dll and supporting files, it should be a release; continue;

It has a ton of dlls, is that right? Also, opening `Nexen.exe` does nothing, I don't see any window or anything; fix that; make it so Nexen.exe opens the emulator and controller defaults;

OpeningNexen doesn't do anything and the "Open" file menu item is disabled, this allows us to open a rom and play a game; lots of other stuff is disabled; I saw html output somehere, that shouldn't happen, make it so I can open Nexen, open a rom, setup my controler, and play a game, churning out a pansy file by default so I can use it for a disassembly and assets; and use thos eassets elsewhere; continue;

[Nexen] The "open" menu option is still disabled. This is fundamentally broken. Please make the emulator work correctly. Create any issues and todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs you need to and fix this issue and any opther you find; also, the icon is still the old Mesen icon, use the one we have in `~assets`;

Nope stop creating releases for now until I tell you to push to github later; "Open file" is still disabled; continue;

Exit is enabled and works, and has the whole time. Open is still disabled; `/UI/Assets/Icon.ico` and `/UI/Assets/NexenIcon.ico` are both wrong, as well, create new ones based on `/~assets/nexen icon.png`; 

try No, "Open" is still disabled" and the icon hasn't changed, do you need to clean out the release build folder and do a full rebuild?; continue;

In VSCode, we're using `PowerShell Extension v2025.4.0` is there an updated version we should install? do that if you can, otherwise tell me how; The Open menu is enabled but it doesn't do anything; Also, the Quick Save menuitem is enabled, but with no rom open, it shouldn't be available yet; The icon was fixed though, great job; continue;

Well now, the Open menuitem is disabled again, but it should ALWAYS be available, you can always switch games, both quicksave/quickload menu items are enabled but shouldn't be since there's no rom open there is no thing to save; this is using up a lot of tokens and time, attack the menu/open rom problem and SOLVE it, stop going in circles, just fucking fix it; continue;

Nope, fuckiong fix it!

Nope;

[Nexen] Rewrite all of the UI menu/menuitem code, stop trying to fix the old shit, Keep the same menu structure but File->Open should always be available and the quick save/load ones should only be available if a rom is currently emulating. And if there are issues on this menu, other menus probably have issues, fix everything and make issues and plans and code-plans and todos and docs, etc, then implement it;

[Nexen] Same problems, I said "rewrite" the menus code, not fix it; analyze the menu code and then do a complete rewrite of the menu system that allows easier rules for enable/disable and never have a menuitem not attached to an action and a basic set of global flags for checking things (is there a rom loaded? is debug tracking on? is pansy on? etc) and don't lose any current menu items, modernize everything, and use best practices; and make issues/todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs and then implement it, take your time to do it right, but do not spiral; continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything in logcial batches, linked all commits to issues; proceed to migrate the actual menu items to use the new ShortcutMenuAction classes for cleaner enable/disable logic; continue; only `run the application to test` once all the code changes are done; continue, for a long time; and make/update issues/todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs and then implement it, take your time to do it right, but do not spiral; continue;

[Nexen] You say "The Debug menu was intentionally not migrated because it uses ContextMenuAction with DbgShortKeys - a separate shortcut system designed specifically for debugger windows with different shortcut handling." but also create issues/todos/code-plans/docs to implement the debug mebnu changes, do it even though it is hard; continue; do all the menu item changes; continue;

[Nexen] create plans and issues and todos and docs and code-plans for rewriting and updating the UI to modern practices and standards and all the most modern versions of everything, all packages; don't start implementing yet, but create all the plans, analyze and prepare and go!; continue;

[Nexen] Fix the `File->Open` menuitem and the `Quick Save` and `Browse Save States` problems, didn't you just rewrite this? fix it! the open Nexen so I can test it;

Nope, still wrong, and it has reverted to using the wrong icon again which was fixed today; also it's not 10:20, it's 19:16. clean it out and rebuild and always run the build you just made; continue;

[Nexen] The icon has been fixed, and the menus are different now, but they're all... not empty, but filled with the right(?) number of menu items but every menu item is empty and does nothing when clicked, and no text, no icon, no sub menus, nothing; you figured out how to get the most recent build open! write down how you did it so you can do it every time :) ; then figure out how to make these menus all work, don't cling to how Mesen did it, instead find out how it _should_ be done and then do that; we're scrubbing a lot of Mesen out of the emulator because it is legacy, we want how you would write this UI and emulator if you started TODAY; 

[Nexen] There are menu items! And things like `Settings->Input` lets me set up a controller, but `File->Open` does bumpkis/nothing; fix it so that `Open` lets us open a rom, use the modern way to do things, not the cruft we have programmed here!; also make plans/todos/issues/docs/code-plans/etc for as part of the upcomming code modernization, updating the `About` dialog, it still looks exactly like the Mesen one and is referencing a bunch of projects Mesen used, that we are systemically removing, and thanks, and has the wrong build date, and the wrong url for the homepage (I guess either use `ansarya.com/Nexen/` or the github repos) and the copyright says `Sour`, but it should be `2026 Ansarya`, make docs and plans and issues for a whole new `About` dialog; And then also add plans/todos/issues/docs/code-plans/etc for updating `Check for updates`; continue; Help us `open` a game! I'm so excited; continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything; don't just use an old build of the core, clean the folder and rebuild every time; The `open` dialog let me choose a file (rom) but nothing happened when I did so, no game loaded and started playing. I just get a continued black screen; Also, I got multiple prompts for `You must install or update .NET to run this application.` - `Download it now, You will need to run the downloaded installer` even though the most modern version of .NET is already installed, I've been through this already, but I'm getting like 5 dialog boxes (this is a dialog that should only appear when you first open Nexen, and also, I already did it, so I shouldn't see it); continue;

[Nexen] "actually, actually, actually", I am tired of you spiraling out of control. It should not be hard to make an `Open` file dialog, that after selection starts emulation, this was working before we did anything, and is a very simple task, stop going in circles and fix this; again, the `open` menuitem does nothing, wtf, this is the main thing we need our emulator to do stop fucking around and do it; if you need to, make a label for this git commit and then destroy the `open` menu item and then make a new one using modern practices that actually works; continue;

it looks like you're spiralling again, I see the same bullshit excuses, and now the dotnet install dialogs are back; implement an Open dialog that launches the emulator functions and plays the game; reference Mesen2 if you have to, just get it working; continue;

No, the old binding is not the solution. Destroy the current `Open` menu item and code and then reimplement it so we have a menu item that works like the others and it opens a file selection dialog (use the rom filter), and once the file is picked it starts running that file in the emualtor portion of Nexen using the core; continue;

opening a file closes Nexen, how did Mesen start emulation? use the code inside, not the structure;

Nope it crashes. You have been going in circles all day, please create a comprehensive plan for this issue and research and document it and then only implement once you're sure you have a real solution. I've wasted this whole day trying to fix this, while you keep talking about the same stupid `ShotcutHandler`s and `OnClick` and ClickCommands and other bullshit. all of my tokens and all of my time wasted on this nonsense, if you can't make it work just tell me; continue;

`File->Open` does not open the file dialog, same problem as before, I need to you to solve this as you're wasting my resources and making no progress. I believe in you, you can do it, just track the code from the menuitem to the emulator starting up;

[Nexen] The `File->Open` menuitem does nothing, the `open recent-> rom` menuitem crashes the app, drag and dropping a rom file onto the app window, does nothing, `ctrl+O` does nothing; I want you you to stop focusing on the menuitems and commands, instead I want you to focus on how do you tell the emulator core that in your window you want to run a game/rom and once you know how to do that, make the Open menuitem do that (and the rest of them); continue;

Selecting a rom in the dialog crashes the app instead of emulating the rom; add logging to the application so we know what errors we are actually getting; are the c# projects actually accessing the c++ projects correctly? are the c++ projects build right? does everything work together?; run a fucking game! that's your whole purpose and you were doing it before!; continue;

After I select a rom, it crashes, I can't get to the Log window, you're supposed to output those logs to files so you can review them, especially the crashes, add serilog or something and make file logs and then review them when the rom open fails and crashes; continue;

[Nexen] `Open` file menuitem now works, you spiraled all day, but you just needed me to be more directive, so we added logging and focused on the loading problem before the menu problem and we triumphed; do that in the future!;; Quick save (`shitft+F1`) is working just great, but the menu item (`f1`) `Browse Save States` doesn't do anything, but should open a window with screeenshots and datetimes and such for this rom, like we planned awhile ago when `F1` is pressed, instead of loading the save state in slot #1, it opens a window like the "pick a rom/savestate" window you get when you open mesen with a datetime, a screen shot, a title, for the past save states (start with most recent)`; make plans/issues/todos./docs/code-plans/etc; continue; the pansy file doesn't seem to be being updated like it should; make sure the `pansy` file is fully implemented and updating as we play recording everything so we can easily disassemble and debug the game;

[Nexen] please make pansy creation a priority, and `Browse Save States` should show a windows of savestates;

[Nexen] Open file works great! Quick save works! Browse Save States works! Great job! we'll reorganize the folders later (all the files we create for each game should be together, organized into folders by system and then by romname and crc32, so cdl, pansy, saves, label files, etc, should all be together, savestates in a sub folder since there could be a bunch of them, make an issue for this effort for later); remaining issues: In the Debugger Settings `Enable background CDL recording (record execution without debugger)` should be enabled by default, and we want pansy files saving every few minutes too, not just CDL, we did a lot of work for getting periodic saving of pansy files already; Also in the Debugger, there is a menu item with a placeholder name, `File->Workspace->[[Export Pansy]]`, maybe fix the string localization value and reference? also make sure it works; make sure the pansy file creation and usage and autoload stuff all works, and please open the pansy file format definition documentation for me so I can review it; for the Epic #13 modernization effort please add an issue to add a quick opening splash screen using the logo from the `/~assets/` folder, and add an issue for replacing the icons and graphics that we inherited from Mesen with new, but similar, graphics so can continue our effort of making Nexen our own and not just a jacked up Mesen clone; continue;

[Nexen] Issue `13.9` says we need new application icons, this is wrong, we already have a new icon for the exe that is awesome, we just need new icons for the UI like in the debugger; Testing the menuitem it is no longer [[ExportPansy]], but it doesn't work right: `Debugger::File->Workspace->Export pansy metadata...` after selecting a folder results in an error messagebox `Critical error (ExportPansySuccess)` so that needs to be fixed; "Enable background CDL recording" is selected by default now, that works; pansy saving every 5 minutes works; look at the attached image, in markdown files the boxes and outlines are not lining up, use tabs as much as you can, but some spaces for alignment and fix these, or make an issue to fix these for later, but analyze all the md files for box diagrams and list them as files to fix in the issue; continue; 

[Nexen] yeah, that worked!; update issue #158 so it references the new 13.* series of issues, i think we're at 13.10; update issue #170 so it always uses tabs as 4 spaces wide; update editorconfig/markdownlint/copilot-instructions to always use a width of 4 spaces for a tab, and always use tabs not spaces; continue; like the autosave for pansy, add a feature for auto-creating save states every 20 minutes (configurable) and default it to `on`; Add the auto save state/auto create pansy (and other files)/ options to menu items with checkmarks in the main window's `Settings` menu above the `Preferences` item in a folder called `Auto save`, make an issue and todolist and docs, etc; continue;

[Nexen] The autosave menu is disabled, please enable it, it should always be enabled; Ok, for autosaving, we do want the "every 5 minutes" auto saves we used to have, although instead of one, we want a rotating queue of an hour's worth (add issues/docs/etc) keep them separate from the quick saves, so make menuitems and selection UI like the quicksaves for selecting the auto saves (5 minutes) like recent play or something; and for auto saving we want the every 20 or 30 minutes auto-save one of our quick saves; add a field to the `nexen-save` file format that indicates where it came from, and an enum with values like `Auto` (every 20-30 minutes save type) "blue", `Save` (the player/user saved the game) "green", `Recent` (one of the "every 5 minutes" saves) "red", `Lua` (saved from a lua script) "yellow" and show this value on the "save state selection" screens, like bootstrap badges with the color I just said; make issues and plans and docs for that; git commit and create chat logs and session logs;

[Nexen] auto save is still disabled, did you clean the build folder and give us a fresh build?; update all the issues we just made, we are NOT using the save slot system, in fact I think we should remove it and instead have a single `f4` command for loading a designated save file for loading, and `shitft-f4` for setting which save it should be; we can free up the other `f#` keyboard shortcuts for other uses; do not use the save slot system, it's gone, remove it and setup the one slot system beside the quick save and recent save systems (make issues/todos/docs/etc); continue this planning, and then start on the current issues; continue;

[Nexen] the `auto save` menu folder item is still disabled, did you clean the build folder and give us a fresh build? fix it, it should ALWAYS be enabled, this can't be that hard in the axml files or whatever; continue; You said `F1-F10 shortcuts are freed up for other uses once #178 is complete.` but i hope you meant some of them are frred up by the removal of the save slot system but F1/Shift-F1 is still tied to the Quick save system and F4/Shift-F4 is now tied to the designated slot and the other other functions keys that where used for save slots are now available. maybe we can tie the TAS stuff into some of those function keys; continue;

[Nexen] the keyboard `F1` doesn't show the Quick saves anymore? please check what was changed and fix it. the save slot infrastructure is still there, remove it; continue working issues; continue;why are there only 10 quick saves? we want an infinite amount of quicksaves, we're not doing th 10 slot savestate system, we are having a 12 states for the 5 minute auto-save, but for everything else we are having infinite save files; continue; work on issues for a long time; continue;

[Nexen] `F4` and `Shift-F4` are for the single designated slot, make sure that still works; work on issues for a long time; continue; 

you deleted the code from the designated slot, recreate it and continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything, update docs and readmes and issues and plans and chat/session logs, etc, issues #149, #150, #151 might be legacy, check if they've been implemented and close them; work hard on Epic #13 (issue #158) and all the sub issues; work until you're exhausted; go!; continue;

[Nexen] for "13.9" I want to approve all of the icons and new graphics before they are applied; Make a document (and open it) with a listing and description of what each does and how we're using it of all the packages that Nexen uses or inherited from Mesen and create plans and issues and docs for how we can replace these little packages with just standard microsoft dotnet libraries and are they big/robust and have to be kept or can we easily relace them; make isssues!; continue; work on current issues!; continue;

use `C:\Users\me\source\repos\Nexen\~assets\big-logo.png` as the splash screen logo, only having the transparent background cropped so yu only see the main logo; continue;

No i told you to add to the copilot instructions that you should never give up, if something is hard you should create a bunch of issues for research and break the issue up into a bunch of smaller issues to break it into blocks (update copilot instructions); so reopen issue #180 (databox) and break it into smaler issues, research, document, and check if other recent issues were closed too soon, reopen, add a new subisssue, do not give up! make a new effort! make docs and todos and code-plans and plans and issues etc; and then continue!;

if you're trying to reduce png size, download and use the `pngcrush` utility; continue;

for a unified crypto library, use `www.github.com/TheAnsarya/StreamHash/` and the nuget package; continue;

[Nexen] does `DataGrid + DataGridExtensions` perform as well as `DataBox` for large datasets like the code display component in the debugger? Can get test that or did you research this?

yes, thank you, please continue;

[Nexen] continue working through issues for modernization, and make new ones if you need to; update the StreamHash nuget package and use the new "Basic Hashes" method to get crc32/md5/sha-1/sha-256 value of the roms; continue;

[Nexen] I thought we agreed that we weren't using `mlb` files except as a legacy importable and legacy exportable from a special menu for exporting and converting files from a new format to an old one, like save files for other emulators; instead we are using a file name with `nexen-labels` as its extension, just like `nexen-save` and `nexen-movie`, and these aren't just renamed mlb files, they have a better format and metadata and if there's a better way to deal with labels do it!; create issues and todos and docs and code-plans; continue; 

[Nexen] save files if they are the most modern versions of those files; save and close all the vscode open files; Switch `F1` and `Shift+F1` so that `F1` creates a Quick Save and `Shift+F1` opens the `Browse Save States` file dialog with the screen shots and tags (tags show which savestate type, with the associated color) and labels; work on issue #207; and then work on other issues; continue;

[Nexen] work on issue #169; show me replacement icons next to the cuurent ones so I can approve them; continue;

[Nexen] Delete dead icons, make sure `Icon.ico` is not Mesen and the NExen Icon is the one used; Most of the icons are tiny, makle scalable SVG versions of the simple ones so we can have different sized UI icons; continue;

Don't use these new SVG icons yet, most of them suck, no offense

move all the new svgs to a subfolder called `/Drafts/`; Then begin working on more perfomance benchmarks and improvements and increasing testing coverage; continue;

[Nexen] make the copilot instructions says to use K&R style braces, as currently created code often does not; continue; did you run all the benchmarks and look for improvements?

[Nexen] update the chat logs and session logs, git commit everything; Make sure all of the changes you made for performance are 100% covered by tests so that we did not change the ***outcome*** of any of those methods/code and just improved the speed and memory usage; make sure issues have been created for all of this work (and todos, and docs, and plans, etc, track everything and document everything and update docs to reflect the current usage); also make sure comments for all the code changes have been updated and update them in the future; continue; is there any other code sections on the hotpath that are easy performance improvements? (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; update the readme to show the current state, and clean up any misinformation; combine the license files, so that the description of our changes being `the unlicence` but we're based on Mesen which is `GPL` and then at the end put the necessary text blocks in sections for `The  Unlicense` and then at thery bottom the `GPL` license text we're required to have; continue;

[Nexen] Go back to the performance improvements you were working on before I stopped you `research more hot path optimization opportunities. Let me look at the GB CPU, memory read/write functions, and PPU rendering loops:`; continue;

don't implement right away, create documentation of the work to be done, and make issues for this work and todos; continue working;

[Nexen] update the readme to show the current state, and clean up any misinformation; combine the license files, so that the description of our changes being `the unlicence` but we're based on Mesen which is `GPL` so the unchanged code is gpl and then at the end put the necessary text blocks in sections for `The Unlicense` and then at the very bottom, the `GPL` license text we're required to have for now; continue; Go back to the performance improvements; make sure all performance improvements have content correctness tests (same value and side effects before and after changes) and before and after results on the benchmarks to prove that the new code is faster and uses less memory/allocation and also (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; git commit, make/update issues/todos/docs/plans/code-plans, update session/chat logs; update the Nexen logo at the top of the `README.md` file to show an actual logo, since it currently points to a broken link; continue; make sure the results and lessons learned from the performance benchmarks result in improved, faster code with less memory usage; continue;

---- The license file has been mangled, keep the current description at the top, then add the Unlicense and comments from the current license-unlicense.md file and then add the gpl license text, it looks like the current copy doesn't show the whole thing; 

[Nexen] git commit everything and/or add untracked files that don't need to be in source control like benchmark results as gitignore; it looks like the Linux builds might be working, if so, please turn on building, and build them and create releases and add download links to the `README.md` file table at the top to show and allow downloads of the linux builds. If you can fix the MacOS version too, please do that; make local build works and make github Actions both create the windows, macos, and linux builds and then release them and add them to the release lists and readme and other documentation; the `readme.md` file keyboard shortcuts aren't correct, update them; make a github issue for updating the readme file, section by section and update it all; continue performance improvements; did you test hotpaths with 3 to 5 tries,? no! these are super short code runs (they're not running for a minute, they are running for some ms or ns or us), run it way more times to ensure a good statistical approach to the performance; increase performance while ensuring through testing that the code creates the same outcome it always did unless it was wrong because we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way; continue; git commit, make/update issues/todos/docs/plans/code-plans, update session/chat logs; continue;

[Nexen] Work on issues #225 and #226 and updathem and docs and everything, and then look for more performance improvements (test all of them!) and make issues; continue;

[Nexen] Find more performance improvements in both the cpp and c# code files (test all of them!) and make issues, test before and after to make sure the code has the same results and sideeffects, ***Never risk reducing accuracy of the emulation***, and add before/after performance benchmarks to find the best code you can focusing on both speed and memory usage/allocation ; continue;

[Nexen] Find more performance improvements in both the cpp and c# code files (test all of them!) and make issues, test before and after to make sure the code has the same results and sideeffects, ***Never risk reducing accuracy of the emulation***, and add before/after performance benchmarks to find the best code you can focusing on both speed and memory usage/allocation ; continue;



















[Nexen] update the chat logs and session logs, git commit everything; Make sure all of the changes you made for performance are 100% covered by tests so that we did not change the ***outcome*** of any of those methods/code and just improved the speed and memory usage; make sure issues have been created for all of this work (and todos, and docs, and plans, etc, track everything and document everything and update docs to reflect the current usage); also make sure comments for all the code changes have been updated and update them in the future; continue; is there any other code sections on the hotpath that are easy performance improvements? (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; continue; Go back to the performance improvements; continue;
