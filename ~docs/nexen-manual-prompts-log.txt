There is never Mesen anything; We are Nexen now; continue;

always focus on the release build, but I was was using a release build of 1.0.0 and it did not run correctly, make the release build run; fix all issues and problems and code issues; we want our released version to work; continue;

Release version 1.0.1 update docs, and make sure this runs! continue;

Release Nexen 1.0.1 on github; comtmue;

The 1.0.1 release zip should not have all the code of this project, it should have only that exe and dll and supporting files, it should be a release; continue;

It has a ton of dlls, is that right? Also, opening `Nexen.exe` does nothing, I don't see any window or anything; fix that; make it so Nexen.exe opens the emulator and controller defaults;

OpeningNexen doesn't do anything and the "Open" file menu item is disabled, this allows us to open a rom and play a game; lots of other stuff is disabled; I saw html output somehere, that shouldn't happen, make it so I can open Nexen, open a rom, setup my controler, and play a game, churning out a pansy file by default so I can use it for a disassembly and assets; and use thos eassets elsewhere; continue;

[Nexen] The "open" menu option is still disabled. This is fundamentally broken. Please make the emulator work correctly. Create any issues and todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs you need to and fix this issue and any opther you find; also, the icon is still the old Mesen icon, use the one we have in `~assets`;

Nope stop creating releases for now until I tell you to push to github later; "Open file" is still disabled; continue;

Exit is enabled and works, and has the whole time. Open is still disabled; `/UI/Assets/Icon.ico` and `/UI/Assets/NexenIcon.ico` are both wrong, as well, create new ones based on `/~assets/nexen icon.png`; 

try No, "Open" is still disabled" and the icon hasn't changed, do you need to clean out the release build folder and do a full rebuild?; continue;

In VSCode, we're using `PowerShell Extension v2025.4.0` is there an updated version we should install? do that if you can, otherwise tell me how; The Open menu is enabled but it doesn't do anything; Also, the Quick Save menuitem is enabled, but with no rom open, it shouldn't be available yet; The icon was fixed though, great job; continue;

Well now, the Open menuitem is disabled again, but it should ALWAYS be available, you can always switch games, both quicksave/quickload menu items are enabled but shouldn't be since there's no rom open there is no thing to save; this is using up a lot of tokens and time, attack the menu/open rom problem and SOLVE it, stop going in circles, just fucking fix it; continue;

Nope, fuckiong fix it!

Nope;

[Nexen] Rewrite all of the UI menu/menuitem code, stop trying to fix the old shit, Keep the same menu structure but File->Open should always be available and the quick save/load ones should only be available if a rom is currently emulating. And if there are issues on this menu, other menus probably have issues, fix everything and make issues and plans and code-plans and todos and docs, etc, then implement it;

[Nexen] Same problems, I said "rewrite" the menus code, not fix it; analyze the menu code and then do a complete rewrite of the menu system that allows easier rules for enable/disable and never have a menuitem not attached to an action and a basic set of global flags for checking things (is there a rom loaded? is debug tracking on? is pansy on? etc) and don't lose any current menu items, modernize everything, and use best practices; and make issues/todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs and then implement it, take your time to do it right, but do not spiral; continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything in logcial batches, linked all commits to issues; proceed to migrate the actual menu items to use the new ShortcutMenuAction classes for cleaner enable/disable logic; continue; only `run the application to test` once all the code changes are done; continue, for a long time; and make/update issues/todos/docs/code-plans/plans/logs and then implement it, take your time to do it right, but do not spiral; continue;

[Nexen] You say "The Debug menu was intentionally not migrated because it uses ContextMenuAction with DbgShortKeys - a separate shortcut system designed specifically for debugger windows with different shortcut handling." but also create issues/todos/code-plans/docs to implement the debug mebnu changes, do it even though it is hard; continue; do all the menu item changes; continue;

[Nexen] create plans and issues and todos and docs and code-plans for rewriting and updating the UI to modern practices and standards and all the most modern versions of everything, all packages; don't start implementing yet, but create all the plans, analyze and prepare and go!; continue;

[Nexen] Fix the `File->Open` menuitem and the `Quick Save` and `Browse Save States` problems, didn't you just rewrite this? fix it! the open Nexen so I can test it;

Nope, still wrong, and it has reverted to using the wrong icon again which was fixed today; also it's not 10:20, it's 19:16. clean it out and rebuild and always run the build you just made; continue;

[Nexen] The icon has been fixed, and the menus are different now, but they're all... not empty, but filled with the right(?) number of menu items but every menu item is empty and does nothing when clicked, and no text, no icon, no sub menus, nothing; you figured out how to get the most recent build open! write down how you did it so you can do it every time :) ; then figure out how to make these menus all work, don't cling to how Mesen did it, instead find out how it _should_ be done and then do that; we're scrubbing a lot of Mesen out of the emulator because it is legacy, we want how you would write this UI and emulator if you started TODAY; 

[Nexen] There are menu items! And things like `Settings->Input` lets me set up a controller, but `File->Open` does bumpkis/nothing; fix it so that `Open` lets us open a rom, use the modern way to do things, not the cruft we have programmed here!; also make plans/todos/issues/docs/code-plans/etc for as part of the upcomming code modernization, updating the `About` dialog, it still looks exactly like the Mesen one and is referencing a bunch of projects Mesen used, that we are systemically removing, and thanks, and has the wrong build date, and the wrong url for the homepage (I guess either use `ansarya.com/Nexen/` or the github repos) and the copyright says `Sour`, but it should be `2026 Ansarya`, make docs and plans and issues for a whole new `About` dialog; And then also add plans/todos/issues/docs/code-plans/etc for updating `Check for updates`; continue; Help us `open` a game! I'm so excited; continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything; don't just use an old build of the core, clean the folder and rebuild every time; The `open` dialog let me choose a file (rom) but nothing happened when I did so, no game loaded and started playing. I just get a continued black screen; Also, I got multiple prompts for `You must install or update .NET to run this application.` - `Download it now, You will need to run the downloaded installer` even though the most modern version of .NET is already installed, I've been through this already, but I'm getting like 5 dialog boxes (this is a dialog that should only appear when you first open Nexen, and also, I already did it, so I shouldn't see it); continue;

[Nexen] "actually, actually, actually", I am tired of you spiraling out of control. It should not be hard to make an `Open` file dialog, that after selection starts emulation, this was working before we did anything, and is a very simple task, stop going in circles and fix this; again, the `open` menuitem does nothing, wtf, this is the main thing we need our emulator to do stop fucking around and do it; if you need to, make a label for this git commit and then destroy the `open` menu item and then make a new one using modern practices that actually works; continue;

it looks like you're spiralling again, I see the same bullshit excuses, and now the dotnet install dialogs are back; implement an Open dialog that launches the emulator functions and plays the game; reference Mesen2 if you have to, just get it working; continue;

No, the old binding is not the solution. Destroy the current `Open` menu item and code and then reimplement it so we have a menu item that works like the others and it opens a file selection dialog (use the rom filter), and once the file is picked it starts running that file in the emualtor portion of Nexen using the core; continue;

opening a file closes Nexen, how did Mesen start emulation? use the code inside, not the structure;

Nope it crashes. You have been going in circles all day, please create a comprehensive plan for this issue and research and document it and then only implement once you're sure you have a real solution. I've wasted this whole day trying to fix this, while you keep talking about the same stupid `ShotcutHandler`s and `OnClick` and ClickCommands and other bullshit. all of my tokens and all of my time wasted on this nonsense, if you can't make it work just tell me; continue;

`File->Open` does not open the file dialog, same problem as before, I need to you to solve this as you're wasting my resources and making no progress. I believe in you, you can do it, just track the code from the menuitem to the emulator starting up;

[Nexen] The `File->Open` menuitem does nothing, the `open recent-> rom` menuitem crashes the app, drag and dropping a rom file onto the app window, does nothing, `ctrl+O` does nothing; I want you you to stop focusing on the menuitems and commands, instead I want you to focus on how do you tell the emulator core that in your window you want to run a game/rom and once you know how to do that, make the Open menuitem do that (and the rest of them); continue;

Selecting a rom in the dialog crashes the app instead of emulating the rom; add logging to the application so we know what errors we are actually getting; are the c# projects actually accessing the c++ projects correctly? are the c++ projects build right? does everything work together?; run a fucking game! that's your whole purpose and you were doing it before!; continue;

After I select a rom, it crashes, I can't get to the Log window, you're supposed to output those logs to files so you can review them, especially the crashes, add serilog or something and make file logs and then review them when the rom open fails and crashes; continue;

[Nexen] `Open` file menuitem now works, you spiraled all day, but you just needed me to be more directive, so we added logging and focused on the loading problem before the menu problem and we triumphed; do that in the future!;; Quick save (`shitft+F1`) is working just great, but the menu item (`f1`) `Browse Save States` doesn't do anything, but should open a window with screeenshots and datetimes and such for this rom, like we planned awhile ago when `F1` is pressed, instead of loading the save state in slot #1, it opens a window like the "pick a rom/savestate" window you get when you open mesen with a datetime, a screen shot, a title, for the past save states (start with most recent)`; make plans/issues/todos./docs/code-plans/etc; continue; the pansy file doesn't seem to be being updated like it should; make sure the `pansy` file is fully implemented and updating as we play recording everything so we can easily disassemble and debug the game;

[Nexen] please make pansy creation a priority, and `Browse Save States` should show a windows of savestates;

[Nexen] Open file works great! Quick save works! Browse Save States works! Great job! we'll reorganize the folders later (all the files we create for each game should be together, organized into folders by system and then by romname and crc32, so cdl, pansy, saves, label files, etc, should all be together, savestates in a sub folder since there could be a bunch of them, make an issue for this effort for later); remaining issues: In the Debugger Settings `Enable background CDL recording (record execution without debugger)` should be enabled by default, and we want pansy files saving every few minutes too, not just CDL, we did a lot of work for getting periodic saving of pansy files already; Also in the Debugger, there is a menu item with a placeholder name, `File->Workspace->[[Export Pansy]]`, maybe fix the string localization value and reference? also make sure it works; make sure the pansy file creation and usage and autoload stuff all works, and please open the pansy file format definition documentation for me so I can review it; for the Epic #13 modernization effort please add an issue to add a quick opening splash screen using the logo from the `/~assets/` folder, and add an issue for replacing the icons and graphics that we inherited from Mesen with new, but similar, graphics so can continue our effort of making Nexen our own and not just a jacked up Mesen clone; continue;

[Nexen] Issue `13.9` says we need new application icons, this is wrong, we already have a new icon for the exe that is awesome, we just need new icons for the UI like in the debugger; Testing the menuitem it is no longer [[ExportPansy]], but it doesn't work right: `Debugger::File->Workspace->Export pansy metadata...` after selecting a folder results in an error messagebox `Critical error (ExportPansySuccess)` so that needs to be fixed; "Enable background CDL recording" is selected by default now, that works; pansy saving every 5 minutes works; look at the attached image, in markdown files the boxes and outlines are not lining up, use tabs as much as you can, but some spaces for alignment and fix these, or make an issue to fix these for later, but analyze all the md files for box diagrams and list them as files to fix in the issue; continue; 

[Nexen] yeah, that worked!; update issue #158 so it references the new 13.* series of issues, i think we're at 13.10; update issue #170 so it always uses tabs as 4 spaces wide; update editorconfig/markdownlint/copilot-instructions to always use a width of 4 spaces for a tab, and always use tabs not spaces; continue; like the autosave for pansy, add a feature for auto-creating save states every 20 minutes (configurable) and default it to `on`; Add the auto save state/auto create pansy (and other files)/ options to menu items with checkmarks in the main window's `Settings` menu above the `Preferences` item in a folder called `Auto save`, make an issue and todolist and docs, etc; continue;

[Nexen] The autosave menu is disabled, please enable it, it should always be enabled; Ok, for autosaving, we do want the "every 5 minutes" auto saves we used to have, although instead of one, we want a rotating queue of an hour's worth (add issues/docs/etc) keep them separate from the quick saves, so make menuitems and selection UI like the quicksaves for selecting the auto saves (5 minutes) like recent play or something; and for auto saving we want the every 20 or 30 minutes auto-save one of our quick saves; add a field to the `nexen-save` file format that indicates where it came from, and an enum with values like `Auto` (every 20-30 minutes save type) "blue", `Save` (the player/user saved the game) "green", `Recent` (one of the "every 5 minutes" saves) "red", `Lua` (saved from a lua script) "yellow" and show this value on the "save state selection" screens, like bootstrap badges with the color I just said; make issues and plans and docs for that; git commit and create chat logs and session logs;

[Nexen] auto save is still disabled, did you clean the build folder and give us a fresh build?; update all the issues we just made, we are NOT using the save slot system, in fact I think we should remove it and instead have a single `f4` command for loading a designated save file for loading, and `shitft-f4` for setting which save it should be; we can free up the other `f#` keyboard shortcuts for other uses; do not use the save slot system, it's gone, remove it and setup the one slot system beside the quick save and recent save systems (make issues/todos/docs/etc); continue this planning, and then start on the current issues; continue;

[Nexen] the `auto save` menu folder item is still disabled, did you clean the build folder and give us a fresh build? fix it, it should ALWAYS be enabled, this can't be that hard in the axml files or whatever; continue; You said `F1-F10 shortcuts are freed up for other uses once #178 is complete.` but i hope you meant some of them are frred up by the removal of the save slot system but F1/Shift-F1 is still tied to the Quick save system and F4/Shift-F4 is now tied to the designated slot and the other other functions keys that where used for save slots are now available. maybe we can tie the TAS stuff into some of those function keys; continue;

[Nexen] the keyboard `F1` doesn't show the Quick saves anymore? please check what was changed and fix it. the save slot infrastructure is still there, remove it; continue working issues; continue;why are there only 10 quick saves? we want an infinite amount of quicksaves, we're not doing th 10 slot savestate system, we are having a 12 states for the 5 minute auto-save, but for everything else we are having infinite save files; continue; work on issues for a long time; continue;

[Nexen] `F4` and `Shift-F4` are for the single designated slot, make sure that still works; work on issues for a long time; continue; 

you deleted the code from the designated slot, recreate it and continue;

[Nexen] git commit everything, update docs and readmes and issues and plans and chat/session logs, etc, issues #149, #150, #151 might be legacy, check if they've been implemented and close them; work hard on Epic #13 (issue #158) and all the sub issues; work until you're exhausted; go!; continue;

[Nexen] for "13.9" I want to approve all of the icons and new graphics before they are applied; Make a document (and open it) with a listing and description of what each does and how we're using it of all the packages that Nexen uses or inherited from Mesen and create plans and issues and docs for how we can replace these little packages with just standard microsoft dotnet libraries and are they big/robust and have to be kept or can we easily relace them; make isssues!; continue; work on current issues!; continue;

use `C:\Users\me\source\repos\Nexen\~assets\big-logo.png` as the splash screen logo, only having the transparent background cropped so yu only see the main logo; continue;

No i told you to add to the copilot instructions that you should never give up, if something is hard you should create a bunch of issues for research and break the issue up into a bunch of smaller issues to break it into blocks (update copilot instructions); so reopen issue #180 (databox) and break it into smaler issues, research, document, and check if other recent issues were closed too soon, reopen, add a new subisssue, do not give up! make a new effort! make docs and todos and code-plans and plans and issues etc; and then continue!;

if you're trying to reduce png size, download and use the `pngcrush` utility; continue;

for a unified crypto library, use `www.github.com/TheAnsarya/StreamHash/` and the nuget package; continue;

[Nexen] does `DataGrid + DataGridExtensions` perform as well as `DataBox` for large datasets like the code display component in the debugger? Can get test that or did you research this?

yes, thank you, please continue;

[Nexen] continue working through issues for modernization, and make new ones if you need to; update the StreamHash nuget package and use the new "Basic Hashes" method to get crc32/md5/sha-1/sha-256 value of the roms; continue;

[Nexen] I thought we agreed that we weren't using `mlb` files except as a legacy importable and legacy exportable from a special menu for exporting and converting files from a new format to an old one, like save files for other emulators; instead we are using a file name with `nexen-labels` as its extension, just like `nexen-save` and `nexen-movie`, and these aren't just renamed mlb files, they have a better format and metadata and if there's a better way to deal with labels do it!; create issues and todos and docs and code-plans; continue; 

[Nexen] save files if they are the most modern versions of those files; save and close all the vscode open files; Switch `F1` and `Shift+F1` so that `F1` creates a Quick Save and `Shift+F1` opens the `Browse Save States` file dialog with the screen shots and tags (tags show which savestate type, with the associated color) and labels; work on issue #207; and then work on other issues; continue;

[Nexen] work on issue #169; show me replacement icons next to the cuurent ones so I can approve them; continue;

[Nexen] Delete dead icons, make sure `Icon.ico` is not Mesen and the NExen Icon is the one used; Most of the icons are tiny, makle scalable SVG versions of the simple ones so we can have different sized UI icons; continue;

Don't use these new SVG icons yet, most of them suck, no offense

move all the new svgs to a subfolder called `/Drafts/`; Then begin working on more perfomance benchmarks and improvements and increasing testing coverage; continue;

[Nexen] make the copilot instructions says to use K&R style braces, as currently created code often does not; continue; did you run all the benchmarks and look for improvements?

[Nexen] update the chat logs and session logs, git commit everything; Make sure all of the changes you made for performance are 100% covered by tests so that we did not change the ***outcome*** of any of those methods/code and just improved the speed and memory usage; make sure issues have been created for all of this work (and todos, and docs, and plans, etc, track everything and document everything and update docs to reflect the current usage); also make sure comments for all the code changes have been updated and update them in the future; continue; is there any other code sections on the hotpath that are easy performance improvements? (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; update the readme to show the current state, and clean up any misinformation; combine the license files, so that the description of our changes being `the unlicence` but we're based on Mesen which is `GPL` and then at the end put the necessary text blocks in sections for `The  Unlicense` and then at thery bottom the `GPL` license text we're required to have; continue;

[Nexen] Go back to the performance improvements you were working on before I stopped you `research more hot path optimization opportunities. Let me look at the GB CPU, memory read/write functions, and PPU rendering loops:`; continue;

don't implement right away, create documentation of the work to be done, and make issues for this work and todos; continue working;

[Nexen] update the readme to show the current state, and clean up any misinformation; combine the license files, so that the description of our changes being `the unlicence` but we're based on Mesen which is `GPL` so the unchanged code is gpl and then at the end put the necessary text blocks in sections for `The Unlicense` and then at the very bottom, the `GPL` license text we're required to have for now; continue; Go back to the performance improvements; make sure all performance improvements have content correctness tests (same value and side effects before and after changes) and before and after results on the benchmarks to prove that the new code is faster and uses less memory/allocation and also (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; git commit, make/update issues/todos/docs/plans/code-plans, update session/chat logs; update the Nexen logo at the top of the `README.md` file to show an actual logo, since it currently points to a broken link; continue; make sure the results and lessons learned from the performance benchmarks result in improved, faster code with less memory usage; continue;

---- The license file has been mangled, keep the current description at the top, then add the Unlicense and comments from the current license-unlicense.md file and then add the gpl license text, it looks like the current copy doesn't show the whole thing; 

[Nexen] git commit everything and/or add untracked files that don't need to be in source control like benchmark results as gitignore; it looks like the Linux builds might be working, if so, please turn on building, and build them and create releases and add download links to the `README.md` file table at the top to show and allow downloads of the linux builds. If you can fix the MacOS version too, please do that; make local build works and make github Actions both create the windows, macos, and linux builds and then release them and add them to the release lists and readme and other documentation; the `readme.md` file keyboard shortcuts aren't correct, update them; make a github issue for updating the readme file, section by section and update it all; continue performance improvements; did you test hotpaths with 3 to 5 tries,? no! these are super short code runs (they're not running for a minute, they are running for some ms or ns or us), run it way more times to ensure a good statistical approach to the performance; increase performance while ensuring through testing that the code creates the same outcome it always did unless it was wrong because we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way; continue; git commit, make/update issues/todos/docs/plans/code-plans, update session/chat logs; continue;

[Nexen] Work on issues #225 and #226 and updathem and docs and everything, and then look for more performance improvements (test all of them!) and make issues; continue;

[Nexen] Find more performance improvements in both the cpp and c# code files (test all of them!) and make issues, test before and after to make sure the code has the same results and sideeffects, ***Never risk reducing accuracy of the emulation***, and add before/after performance benchmarks to find the best code you can focusing on both speed and memory usage/allocation ; continue;

[Nexen] Find more performance improvements in both the cpp and c# code files (test all of them!) and make issues, test before and after to make sure the code has the same results and sideeffects, ***Never risk reducing accuracy of the emulation***, and add before/after performance benchmarks to find the best code you can focusing on both speed and memory usage/allocation ; continue;

[Nexen] Find more performance improvements in both the cpp and c# code files (test all of them!) and make issues, test before and after to make sure the code has the same results and sideeffects, ***Never risk reducing accuracy of the emulation*** (although if you can show emulator hotpaths still work correctly, then it is ok to update for performance, just test everything!), and add before/after performance benchmarks to find the best code you can focusing on both speed and memory usage/allocation ; continue;

[Nexen] Issue #169 is future development, so side-line it for now. Look at the other issues and work on their efforts making performance and memory gains, and increase tesing, update the issues/todos/docs/etc, then release a new version (minor version update) and try to use the Actions to create releases for windows, macos, and linux; wait for those releases, did they work? if not fix the actions so those builds are created;

[Nexen] The releases are not building why not? create a reasearch issue for why the releases aren't building; You can build the windows release lcoally and then upload it, but we can't build macos or linux on our own (can we? fix it!) and  document and implement the changes, make our release CI/CD work for all platforms, why doesn't it work? can we fix those problems or are they built into the platform? go!; continue;

Linux AppImages are broken (only 0.1 MB - needs investigation); macOS can't be built locally on Windows (requires actual Mac)

why are MacOS release builds not being created and pusblished?

make a MacOS SecKeychainItemImport signing certificate, so we can build without problems, make linux and window builds too in CI, look at the errors and fix them one by one; until everything builds and releases, then update the links in `README.md`; continue;

Nexen v1.1.0 does not open, make the Windows release work; so we can play a game;

[Nexen] Make sure the current release opens and plays games, make a new windows release `1.1.1` if necessary, I need to open the mulator, then add a joypad and test everything and create a comprehensive pansy file and test if it is making a correct file and then use it; continue; 

[Nexen] work on issue #238 `[Research] CI/CD Build Failures for v1.1.0 Release`, and prepare a document with the findings of what our blocks and errors are so we can plan more specifically as you've spent a lot of time on this issue without producing linux or macos versions and only one windows version for the releases, and none of the `README.md` links work; continue;

[Nexen] OK, fix the release problems: change the `build.yml` to remove macos aot temporarily, generate a new release `1.1.2` and insure afterwards that the readme release links work (update the macos aot release table row with an indication that it is broken, and an explaination of why), update issue #238; format all the markdown documents (markdownlinter) and ensure TABS NOT SPACES, and fix all the minor formatting warnings like MD031 (but ignore MD029 as some lists need to be split across sections); update chat/session logs, update docs and todolists and plans and git commit; continue;

[Nexen] update the `build.yml` so our CI build/release includes a version number at the end of the filename for each build release file, like `Nexen-Windows-x64.exe` becomes `Nexen-Windows-x64-v1.1.4.exe`; re-release 1.1.4 with version numbers on the releases (or just rename the release asset files and fix all references); fix the `README.md` "releases" section to point to the files with version numbers and update copilot instructions to always update those links whenever a new release is published; continue;

[Nexen] update the `build.yml` because our Linux releases don't have extensions, aren't they zips or tarballs or something? fix the CI action for releases, rename those files for the 1.1.4 release (reupload assets), and update references and links, update the `readme.md` file "releases" section with the corrected names; continue; ;; github says 14.3% of our codebase is in `C` (not c++, not c#) but we shouldn't be using C directly, what parts of this project are in C, is it libraries or our code?; continue;

it looks like `Nexen-Windows-x64-v1.1.4.exe` is there, I just downloaded it, is it not? if so fix it

[Nexen] update chat/session logs, git commit the prompts file; make issues/todos/docs/plans for this work effort: can we replace the Lua `C` code with a library or nuget package or something? or do we need to keep it because of our customizations? does interacting with our emulation core require us to have all of this code or can we have a smaller project and just use a library? what have we added to the base code that makes us have to compile it ourselves?; continue;

[Nexen] Make a tag for this git-commit so we can reference it later if this effort doesn't work out; Work heavily on issue #239 and figure out how to simplify our Lua codebase and make sub issues if needed after research and testing and benchmarking, before implementing the changes, but only if merited; continue testing and updating until this issue is done; go for a long time, work work work, I'll be back later, make significant progress while I am gone; continue;

[Nexen] Do NOT accept the 2.5x slowdown in performance for the Lua hook, instead check if new versions of Lua handle this better, so what version of Lua is our code based on? What's the current modern Lua version? are there performance improvements on hooks or a better different approach? document/issues/etc; And then also implement the other performance improvements you found in Lua with the sandbox flag, and update documents/issues/etc and chat/session logs and git commit the changes, all linked to an issue; continue;

how many tests and benchmarks do we have? do we have before/after benchmark numbers I can use to impress?

no, how many C# and c++ tests do we have for the whole Nexen project? And how many performance benchmarks (c++ and c#) do we have for the whole project?

[Nexen] What? keyboard shortcuts got reversed again after changes or something, did you revert code? `F1` should make an infinite savestate (Quick Save), and `Shift-F1` should open the browse savestates graphical dialog; Also, `Browse Recent Play Saves` and `Browse Auto Saves` menu options are never made available and those files are never being saved; The Autosave folder under Settings is never available, but it should be always available; did something happen to this work? whatever happened, create docs/plans/issues/etc and make these features work again; continue;

[Nexen] Did you finish that savestate work and update all the dcos? Work on this issue until everything is done, and create sub-issues with additional work if you need to; continue;

[Nexen] In the `Browse Save States` menu dialog component UI it should show the "type-of-save" badge on/over the top-left corner of the screenshot, not as an entire line of the save description; make sure the various types of saves are marking themselves as the right type; make sure all those different save types work and are propely saving and displaying and loading; continue; make issues, work them, and update them; continue;

[Nexen] The Entire TAS/movie UI is garbage, did you reverse code here too? Make all the menu show actual descriptions instead of just object class names;  create docs/plans/issues/etc and make these features work again; continue; work for a long time to fix up the tas UI and make sure the piano roll works, but also the rest of the windows and menus and actions; continue;

[Nexen] review the TAS/movie code and UI (especially piano roll) and make sure everything works and is modern (code/packages/standards/practices) and make sure everything is comprehensively tested and performance benchmarked and documented and make any plans and issues and todos for updates and performance improvements and bug fixes after testing; make sure to test all the movie conversion library, with `*.nexen-movie` as our primary format we should already be converting to/from (Auto-conversion from/to several TAS/movie file formats like BizHawk `.bk2`, lsnes `.lsmv`, FCEUX `.fm2`, Snes9x `.smv`, VisualBoyAdvance `.vbm`, Gens `.gmv`) so test it! thoroughly! (if you need files for testing converting one kind of file to another, look at `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo\~tas-files\` and subfolders, and look at code `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo\src\GameInfoTools.TasConvert*`) ; and add an interupt, or I guess check if this exists first, when you're playing a `nexen-movie` file when not in recording mode, but you press a button on the joypad, it pauses the playback and shows you the piano roll and asks if you want to fork the playback or edit the playback or continue playback (big ass buttons, like cards or something); issues/plans/todos/code-logs/session-logs/code-plans; and test and benchmark the rest of TAS/movies code/ui and find performance improvements in the hot paths, probably amoung recording or playback; make docs and issues and implement them; (git commit as you go, make issues before implementation); make copilot instructions to always create github issues ***BEFORE*** you do the work and then always update the issues during and after the work; continue;

[Nexen] Add to copilot instructions: If you create a github issue from an AI prompt, then make the first comment to that issue `Prompt for work:\r\n{prompt}` to track where this effort came from ; if you can add the prompt to the last few issues that would be great; continue; make TAS/movie improvements; issues / plans / todos / "session/prompt/chat-logs" / session-logs / code-plans; make `nexen-movie` files play, record, edit, and everything back end library files, benchmarked and tested, make sure everything works, analyze and perfect the movie/tas experience; continue;

Nexen] continue working on the TAS/movie issues, look for problems and fix them;

Did you create tests and performance benchmarks for the issues you just fixed? We want tests and benchmarks for every issue that changes code, unless it is super trivial and guaranteed not to cause problems. MAke those tests and benchmarks if you haven't, then work on the other issues;

---------------------- Discord post
Hey guys, I shouldn't discuss it quite yet, since it's not fully tested yet, but am so excited and could use other testers (also if I get hit by a bus today, I'd like someone to know it's there) and I am hoping to do a real public release in a couple weeks after finishing my giant todolist of manual testing, plus some others so:
Since @Sour has stopped updating `Mesen2` or communicating at all and I had several ideas, and I've been working on a new assembler `Poppy` and an auto-disassembler `Peony` and a CDL/DiztinGUIsh replacement `Pansy`, I have forked `Mesen2` and made a bunch of updates. 
The "new" emulator is called Nexen (https://github.com/TheAnsarya/Nexen):
* This is all pre-release and big updates are made often!
  * Like I haven't tested and updated the TAS stuff much because I was focused on making sure emulator core performance updates didn't mess up emulation
* Windows, Linux, and MacOS versions in the project releases
* Updated to all the newest stuff
  * C++ updated to C++23
  * C# updated to C#14 and dotnet 10.0
  * nuget packages and c++ libraries, all modernized
  * modern coding standards and practices and c#14 pattern constructs/etc.
* Comprehensive C# and C++ testing (664 tests) and C#/C++ benchmarking (391 performance benchmarks)
  * Performance improvements (with testing to show it didn't change function) across the entire codebase
    * focused on both hotpaths in the emulator core (for every system) and also UI and render code, whole system
  * Large memory/allocation and code speed improvements
* Savestate overhaul
  * Instead of 10 save slots which are annoying and never enough, we have switched to an infinite save-state solution
    * So every time you hit `F1` it saves a timestamped new savestate (organized into folders by system/RomName_CRC32/)
    * When you hit `Shift-F1` it opens a graphical UI for you to select the 
* `Pansy` format auto export (https://github.com/TheAnsarya/pansy)
  * Again, these are are all still beta/alpha and being cleaned up
  * Every five minutes it auto exports a file for full debugging information that is more than CDL, more than DiztinGUIsh (which is where I got this idea, but after getting the Mesen<->DiztinGUIsh streaming socket working, it had the same problems Diz has now with with `bsnesplus` so I removed all that, made a new format, and embeded the fromat into the emulator)
* TAS/Movie format (`*.nexen-movie`) for the recording and replaying of movies
  * Auto-conversion from/to several TAS/movie file formats like BizHawk `.bk2`, lsnes `.lsmv`, FCEUX `.fm2`, Snes9x `.smv`, VisualBoyAdvance `.vbm`, Gens `.gmv`
  * All of the movie record/replay code is working and testing well, but the UI is totally, f'ed up, we'll fix that in the next couple days
  * But basically movie files and TAS editing is close and will be completed before the public release  
This thing is not ready for release but 



























[Nexen] for the work epic: research and determine if we should Create an MCP server for Nexen? Does it help our development efforts to have an api interation with the emulator?; if so Make plans and issues, with multiple epics, and sub-issues of those epics to accomplish this; maybe institute a window screenshot api so we can get illustrations for the documentation;





[Nexen] Make the `README.md` 100% correct, describe the emulator at the top, show main features, especially those we've added since the Mesen fork (like infinite savestates, "TAS movies", pansy output, better per-rom organization of files, massive performance and testing improvements), link to the real releases, make sure every documentation (`*.md) file is linked in the documentation tree starting at the main readme, every documentation should be reachable, make sub pages with descriptions and such;

[Nexen] create epics, issues, plans, docs, etc: analyze all the documentation, and create a docs plan, to make all the documents updated to the current code state, and make everything accurately described and documented; and explain all the menus and dialogs and create a full 












[Nexen] update the chat logs and session logs, git commit everything; Make sure all of the changes you made for performance are 100% covered by tests so that we did not change the ***outcome*** of any of those methods/code and just improved the speed and memory usage; make sure issues have been created for all of this work (and todos, and docs, and plans, etc, track everything and document everything and update docs to reflect the current usage); also make sure comments for all the code changes have been updated and update them in the future; continue; is there any other code sections on the hotpath that are easy performance improvements? (test the hell out of them, we can't afford to reduce emulator accuracy in any way, hit the corner cases! full coverage!); continue; continue; Go back to the performance improvements; continue;
