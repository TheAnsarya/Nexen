## CI/CD Pipeline Fix - Release v1.1.2

**Branch:** master
**Issue:** #238 (closed)
**Tag:** v1.1.2
**Commit:** `d1e32f2e` — `fix(ci): disable macOS AOT builds temporarily (#238)`

## Summary

Fixed the CI/CD release pipeline which was blocked by macOS AOT build failures. The .NET 10 ILC compiler crashes with a segmentation fault when compiling for macOS ARM64 AOT, preventing the release job from running and uploading any artifacts.

## Root Cause

The GitHub Actions release job has `needs: [windows, linux, appimage, macos]`, requiring ALL platform jobs to pass. The macOS AOT job was failing with:

```text
.../ilc" @"obj/Release/native/Nexen.ilc.rsp"" exited with code 139
```

Exit code 139 = SIGSEGV in the .NET IL Compiler. This is a bug in .NET 10.0.3's AOT compiler, not in Nexen code.

## Fix Applied

Temporarily disabled macOS AOT builds:

1. Removed `clang_aot` from macOS build matrix in `.github/workflows/build.yml`
2. Commented out macOS AOT asset copy in release job
3. Updated README.md macOS table to show AOT as unavailable
4. Added explanation linking to issue #238

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.github/workflows/build.yml` | Removed macOS AOT from build matrix |
| `README.md` | Updated macOS AOT row to show unavailable |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Added v1.1.2 release notes |
| `~docs/plans/ci-cd-build-failures-analysis.md` | Created detailed analysis document |

## Commits

- `d1e32f2e` — `fix(ci): disable macOS AOT builds temporarily (#238)`

## Release

- **v1.1.2** created and pushed
- CI workflow triggered for v1.1.2 tag
- Expected assets after CI completes:
	- `Nexen-Windows-x64.exe`
	- `Nexen-Windows-x64-AoT.exe`
	- `Nexen-Linux-x64.AppImage`
	- `Nexen-Linux-ARM64.AppImage`
	- `Nexen-Linux-x64`
	- `Nexen-Linux-ARM64`
	- `Nexen-macOS-ARM64.zip`

## Future Work

When .NET releases an ILC fix:

1. Re-add `clang_aot` to the macOS build matrix
2. Uncomment the release asset copy line
3. Update README to show macOS AOT as available
4. Test with a pre-release tag first
