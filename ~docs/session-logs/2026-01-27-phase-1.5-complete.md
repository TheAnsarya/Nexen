### Phase 1.5 UI Polish - Already Implemented

Upon investigation, discovered that the UI configuration and localization strings for Background CDL Recording were already implemented in previous sessions:

**UI Configuration (DebuggerConfigWindow.axaml):**

- ✅ Checkbox for `BackgroundCdlRecording` (line 244-247)
- ✅ NumericUpDown for `AutoSaveIntervalMinutes` (line 248-256)
- ✅ Checkbox for `SavePansyOnRomUnload` (line 257-260)
- ✅ Proper enable/disable binding based on BackgroundCdlRecording state

**Localization Strings (resources.en.xml):**

- ✅ `chkBackgroundCdlRecording` - "Enable background CDL recording (record execution without debugger)"
- ✅ `lblAutoSaveInterval` - "Auto-save interval:"
- ✅ `lblMinutes` - "minutes"
- ✅ `chkSavePansyOnRomUnload` - "Save .PANSY file when ROM is closed"

**Configuration Properties (IntegrationConfig.cs):**

- ✅ `BackgroundCdlRecording` (bool, default: false)
